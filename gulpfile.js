//You should pass options to the createTasks method below

  //You can add environment-specific vars or general vars

  //If you want to override the environment that the build process uses, specify it here
  //Valid values are: 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'prod'
  //If you omit this (which you probably should), then the environment will be:
  //'local' when running or building on your machine
  //'dev' when calling gulp deploy:dev
  //'qa' when calling gulp deploy:qa
  //'prod' when calling gulp deploy:prod

//This creates several gulp tasks to use during development:
//default, clean, build, build_with_simulator, run, deploy:dev, deploy:qa, deploy:prod

//Note that you can override any task that createTasks added, by redefining it after the call to createTasks
//ex:
// gulp.task('deploy:dev', ['_deploy_prep'], () => {
//   ...do some custom deploy code...
// });

//FAKING DATA AND CONFIG FILES:
gulp.task('_data', () => {
  return gulp.src(['src/data/streetart_config'])
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/app_content'));
